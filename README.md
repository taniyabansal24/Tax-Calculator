### Tax-Calculator

This Tax Calculator is a simple web application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to calculate their overall income after tax deduction based on their gross annual income, extra income, deductions, and age.

#### Features:

1. **Input Validation**: The calculator ensures that users input valid numerical values for gross annual income, extra income, and deductions. Invalid inputs are flagged with error icons and tooltips.

2. **Tax Calculation**: The application calculates the tax based on the total income (gross annual income + extra income - deductions) and the user's age bracket. Tax rates differ for individuals below 40, between 40 and 60, and above 60 years of age.

3. **Responsive Design**: The interface is designed to be responsive, providing a consistent user experience across different devices and screen sizes.
